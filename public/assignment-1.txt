Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms. They are the main components of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, and are essential to modern society's energy needs. Hydrocarbons can be classified into two main groups: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are characterized by a straight or branched chain of carbon atoms, while aromatic hydrocarbons have a ring structure. Hydrocarbons play a crucial role in a variety of industries, including transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. However, their combustion releases greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, making it essential to find cleaner sources of energy.
