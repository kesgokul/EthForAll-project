Hydrocarbons are a group of organic molecules consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms. These compounds are commonly found in fossil fuels, including natural gas, coal, and crude oil, and are critical for meeting global energy demands. Hydrocarbons are broadly divided into two categories based on their structure: aliphatic and aromatic. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are composed of a chain of carbon atoms, whereas aromatic hydrocarbons have a ring-shaped structure. Industries ranging from transportation to agriculture depend heavily on hydrocarbons for fuel and raw material production. Nevertheless, the release of greenhouse gases during their combustion poses a severe threat to the environment, highlighting the need for alternative, sustainable energy sources.
