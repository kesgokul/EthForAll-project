Forgetfully used yarn to install packages and setup the project. So please download and use yarn to install dependencies if you already don't have it..

## To-do:

1. Splash screen, teacher/student, google login page, and sign-up forms. ✅
2. Connecting Arcana auth and collecting user account info to auto fill the sign-up forms. ✅
3. Teacher Select/create class. ✅
4. Dashboards
5. Creating states for teacher and student profiles. // single state for now ✅

6. How to implement different dash Navigation ✅
7. Post data to api from ClassSelect or classSuccess page.
8. Create a "not Logged In" page and use that in all pages instead of navigating straight back to "/login" because Arcanca sLoggedIn takes time.
